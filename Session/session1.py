#python is a interpreted language that is execute code line by line
#diffrence between method and function. both has a () but method has also a with .()
# mutable means you can change

#Data Types in Python
#1.primitive data types    (immutable) (you can not change)
#2.non-primitive data types (mutable) (you can change)

#1. primitive data types
#1) string (str) => char,words,letters,special char,number (string written inside ""/'')
#2) int => numbers 34, 67
#3) float (decimal) => decimal numbers 34.67 , 5.6

#example of str
print("Nikhil2003@gmail.com")
print(type("Nikhil2003@gmail.com"))


#example of int
print(123)
print(type(123))    #type() is inbuild function

#example of decimal
print(1.23)
print(type(1.23))

#example of boolean
print(True)
print(type(True))

#example of boolean
print(False)
print(type(False))


#vriables
